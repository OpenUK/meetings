## Notes:

* Company Secretary Update
    * At the last meeting, we finished the paperwork to clean up membership and that has all been completed at Companies House.
* No quorum for approval of board minutes from the last meeting on 29 May 2025, so this will be moved to the next board meeting. 
* Board updates
    * Need to replace recently departed board members. Next steps:
        * Rebecca Rumbul volunteered to work on a skill matrix
        * Once the skill matrix is completed, consider going out to our network to see who can help fill the gap.
    * Strategy meetings will be on a cadence of end of September / mid October, and then March / April
        * Next one 23-25 September 2025 coinciding with the board meeting
        * Amanda Todo: Canvas board to ensure that 25th September is a suitable date for an in person Strategy meeting.
        * Subsequent strategy meeting to be agreed at this strategy meeting
